Please load the CSV from original_docs for encounter 7877228 to see all healthcare records for this synthetic data case.

Your job is to consume each row separately in this CSV and allocate timestamps for the time that the medical case is written for. Each row has a list of strings that represent one document. It is common that an entire document has a single timestamp described at the top of the document. But be aware that sometimes document chunks are for different timestamps. So read the document like a human would and partition it by timestamps as needed. Don't write code to do this, make this judgement on your own for each row.

Please go through each row in the CSV separately, and save one or more resulting rows in a new CSV in the chronology folder with document_id, mrn, encounter_id, **timestamp**, and content. If the content truly does not have anything resembling a timestamp, it may be null, but this is exceedingly rare.
