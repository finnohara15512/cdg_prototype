Please read and understand @chronology/encounter_7877228_chronological.csv

Your job is to represent the key medical facts for each day during the admission. Under a timestamp day heading, have bulleted points of everything that is in the documents about this encounter. Do not infer anything, only organize the existing facts. Write your output in a .md file. If anything is unclear, do not make assumptions, you may state that certain attributes are unclear. Do not write a script that accomplishes this, do this yourself. Think a lot.

Once the .md is created, restart your context and compare this .md with the original .csv and ensure validity of all statements in the output .md.
