Please consume the synthetic medical encounter described in summary/encounter_7877228_medical_timeline.md.

Please generate a document called "encounter_representation.md" that lists the principal diagnosis, additional diagnoses, supplemental diagnoses, and procedures. These descriptions can be in SNOMED CT or medical language, do not worry about assigning codes. Think a lot.

Once "encounter_representation.md" is created, please critically analyze the results against summary/encounter_7877228_medical_timeline.md. Think a lot. Ensure that the medical facts are clearly present. Update for correctness as needed.
