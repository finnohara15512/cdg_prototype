Please read summary/encounter_7877228_medical_timeline.md and coding/encounter_representation.md to understand this case.

Then, read @coding/0001.pdf, @coding/0002.pdf, and @coding/0003.pdf and summarize key rules that are relevant to this case in a markdown file. Think a lot.
Similarly, review achi.xlsx and icd.xlsx and summarize relevant facts to this case in a markdown file.

Then, produce "7877228_codes.md" that simply has key information about the case (encounter_id, mrn, key dates, etc) then the headings for principal diagnosis, additional diagnoses, supplemental diagnoses, and procedures with bulleted codes and their descriptions (based on icd diagnosis codes and achi procedure codes). Then as another sub-bullet, add two sentences justifying why that code is selected.
